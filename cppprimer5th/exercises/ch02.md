## Chapter 02

### Exercise 2.1

The C and C++ standards do not specify the representation of float, double and long double. It is possible that all three implemented as IEEE double-precision. Nevertheless, for most architectures (gcc, MSVC; x86, x64, ARM) float is indeed a IEEE single-precision floating point number (binary32), and double is a IEEE double-precision floating point number (binary64).

### Exercise 2.2

'float' or 'double' are both acceptable here to represent *rate*, *principle*, *payment*.
